## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"can't open file api.py"**: Make sure you run `python api.py` from inside the `backend/` directory, not from the project root.

2. **Voice Commands Not Working**: 
   - Check microphone permissions in browser
   - Verify Groq API key is set correctly
   - Test with `curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/accessibility-status`

3. **Audio Not Playing**: 
   - Check browser audio permissions
   - Verify audio output device is working
   - Test with different voice commands

4. **Database Connection Errors**: 
   - Verify MySQL is running: `brew services start mysql` (macOS) or `sudo systemctl start mysql` (Linux)
   - Check your `.env` file has the correct MySQL password
   - Test connection: `mysql -u root -p`

5. **Missing Groq API Key**: 
   - Sign up at [groq.com](https://groq.com) to get your API key
   - Add it to `backend/.env` as `GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here`
   - Accept PlayAI TTS terms at: https://console.groq.com/playground?model=playai-tts

6. **Port Already in Use**:
   - Frontend (3000): `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`
   - Backend (5000): `lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9`

7. **Node.js Version Warnings**: The Jest warnings about Node.js v23 are safe to ignore - the app will work fine.

### Accessibility-Specific Troubleshooting

1. **Voice Commands Not Recognized**:
   - Speak clearly and wait for the "listening" indicator
   - Try the tutorial: say "help" to learn proper command phrasing
   - Check microphone input levels in browser settings

2. **Audio Responses Not Playing**:
   - Verify audio is enabled in app settings (toggle switch)
   - Check browser's autoplay policy settings
   - Test with different commands to isolate the issue

3. **Keyboard Navigation Issues**:
   - Ensure focus indicators are visible (blue outline)
   - Test tab order follows logical sequence
   - Verify shortcuts work with Alt+number combinations
